// The solution starts by understanding the crime scene grid setup.
// Each grid cell can hold items, and we are tasked with finding how many items are present in specific cells based on given data.
// First, we read the dimensions of the grid and the number of items found.
// Then, for each item's location, we record its coordinates and count how many items are in that specific cell.
// This is done by treating each cellâ€™s coordinates as a unique identifier.
// After this, we read a list of cells we need to query and look up how many items are present in each of these cells.
// If a cell has no recorded items, it means zero items were found there.
// Finally, we sum up the item counts for all queried cells and print the total.
// This straightforward process mirrors how the problem is presented: mapping input coordinates to cell counts and then querying the required cells to compute the result.
